#Campaign goals

* Campaigns need clear goals which can be used to measure progress
* Goals need to be realilistic and achievable
* Goals should be inspirational and motivating - we need to mobolise people to achieve them
* Goals should be easy to understand and communicate
* Don't overload yourself, so you can achieve, move on and maintain momentum
* Goals should be organised into a development sequence, so we can work from simple steps that we can achieve in the short term and obtain longer term victories
* This allows us to map a route to our destination
* Goals should also be flexible - as the environment changes, we may need to adjust outcome or timeframes
* We need to get consensus on goals, and *also* on how we work towards them - so we are not at cross purposes

#How do we identify goals?

* Who is your target?
* Who are your allies?
* Identify your resources: people, money, time, relationships
* How do you mobilise allies?
* How can you get more people involved?
* How do you publicise and market yourself?
* How to identify vulnerabilities in your target?
* What is the intended outcome?
* What can you realistically achieve with your resources

#Process

* Identify some small, simple actions that people can be mobilised to take - these should work cumulatively towards our overall goals
* Evaluate regularly - are your goals on target? Do you need to adjust your strategy?
* The process should be *iterative* - we should be learning and adjusting all the time. Flexible, fluid, responsive
* Ask for honest feedback
* Be inclusive and value everyone's opinions
* When a goal is achieved, we should communicate it - and tell people how it fits into the bigger picture

#Conclusion

* Be realistic about what you can achieve. Learn from every stage of the process. Be prepared to revisit every aspect of what you're doing, while keeping your eye on the overall prize
